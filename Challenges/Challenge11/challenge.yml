hints:
- content: "\u201CDebug\u201D functionality is left in production. Debug information\
    \ can potentially reveal sensitive information, such as usernames, plugin names,\
    \ full paths to config files, software versions, etc., and provide ways to interact\
    \ with the remote system, bypassing normal user workflow. In this challenge, you\
    \ can request debug information, using two available commands. One of them lists\
    \ the current directory and another - prints the file on the page."
