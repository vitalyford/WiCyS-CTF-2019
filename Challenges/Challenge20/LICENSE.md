If this software causes you to go bananas, accidentally destroys all your data on your laptop, changes all your messages to memes, encrypts your personal information and publishes it online, makes you wake up at 5 am on Sunday morning and exercise, calls all people on your contact list every hour, memefies your life (if it's even a word) calls Microsoft Helpdesk for no valid reason, makes fun of you in your sleep, shocks you if you don't pay attention in class, and frantically starts doing a filibuster speech -- don't blame Russians, blame their subconscious mind.
