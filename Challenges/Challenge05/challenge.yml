hints:
- content: "When you use == to compare values in PHP it forces the interpreter to\
    \ \"convert\" one of the values such that the comparison will make sense.This\
    \ makes it easy for programmers because they don\u2019t have to cast to a different\
    \ type and can simply ask the language to determine what is best.If you used ===\
    \ then PHP would also make sure that the values are of the same type before comparing\
    \ so \u201C 1\u201D =/= True anymore.Beginners to PHP and other type juggling\
    \ languages may be unaware of this issue or the most secure way of approaching\
    \ the problem of comparison when types are not specified.Whoo hoo PHP! https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php\
