- content: Predictable pseudo-random number generation. Pseudo-random number generation
    is often used in cryptography. If the attacker can predict what seed number was
    used to generate a pseudo-random number, then the attacker can end up with calculating
    the keys necessary to decrypt the data.In this case, your goal is to generate
    every possible outcome based on the password generator (which is about 20 different
    outcomes) and try out every one of them.
